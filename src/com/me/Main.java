/*Directions
-create a new class for a bank account
-create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email,
and phone number
-create two additional methods;
1) to allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field)
2) to allow the customer to withdraw funds (this should deduct from
the balance field, but not allow the withdrawal to complete if there
are insufficient funds)
-you will want to create various code in the Main class to confirm
your code is working
-add some println's in the 2 methods above as well*/

package com.me;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
